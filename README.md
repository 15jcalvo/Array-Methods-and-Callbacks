# JavaScript-Foundations

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## Advanced JavaScript

## Array Methods and Callbacks

## Objectives

- Array Methods - demonstrate ability to use `.forEach` `.map` `.reduce` `.filter` and describe their use cases 
- Callbacks - demonstrate the proper use a of a callback function by passing a function to another function as a parameter 
  
## Introduction

In this challenge you will work with a dataset summarizing the SARS pandemic of 2003. As web developers, you will work with JSON data often to interact with servers, summarize data, get images to your page, and more. It is crucial that you cultivate a thorough understanding of data structures and methods early in your career.

The data set you are given (`data.js`) contains daily reports of SARS confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered patients from March to July of 2003 across the world. Each report is an object with the keys `Date`, `Country`, `Cumulative Cases`, `Number of Deaths`, and `Number recovered`. You can read more about the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/sars-outbreak-2003-complete-dataset/version/2).

Your goal today wil be to manipulate the data using array methods and callbacks to determine the overall impact of the SARS virus.

## Completion requirements

Here you'll describe the features and tasks that the student will need to complete in order to finish the module challenge.

Provide all necessary detail in either paragraph form,

1. using
2. a
3. numbered
4. list,
- [ ]  or
- [ ]  with
- [ ]  a
- [ ]  checklist.

Whatever manner most effectively communicates the information (consider whether a specific sequence is required or if illustrating a clear visual hierarchy would be beneficial).

## Stretch goals

Describe the tasks and features that would demonstrate a student's exceptional mastery of these principles — going above and beyond — but that exceeds what is required by the minimum expectations of the module challenge.

You can do this with full paragraphs or by using a checklist.

## Instructions

You may wish to include an ordered list of step-by-steps instructions to guide the student 

1. through
2. a 
3. sequential
4. process.

## Tests

If you're including tests, describe how to run the tests and any setup required. Be as detailed as possible – testing is an area many of our students struggle with.
